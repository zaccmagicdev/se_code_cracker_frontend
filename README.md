# Code Cracker Beta Released!

Code Cracker! A simple logic puzzle game similar to the Israeli puzzle game "Mastermind". This is a fun little game I decided to make for my course final that features:

- Responsive Design - Looks great on all devices
- Scores the user based on how good their guesses are for solving the code 
- Uses an API for an easter egg in the app...
- Features a rule page for playing the game
- Uses reacts useReducer for game functionality

I really hope you have as much fun playing this as I did making it!
This project utilizes JSX and React framework. This is a snippet for what will be a much larger project as a whole...a puzzle game website. Leaderboard and backend for this game will be released in the near future using Mongoose!
